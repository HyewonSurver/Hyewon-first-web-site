<h4>History of the World Wide Web</h4>
<u>British physicist <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> invented the World Wide Web.</u>
Along with colleagues at Geneva-based CERN -- the European Organization for Nuclear Research -- Berners-Lee had been working on the concept since 1989.
Their goal was to combine available technologies and data networks to create a user-friendly system for global communication and information sharing. At the time, they began work on the first WWW server, which they called httpd.
They also dubbed the first client WWW.

<h4>How does the World Wide Web work?</h4>
These pages are the primary component or building blocks of the WWW and are linked through hyperlinks, which provide access from one specific spot in a hypertext or hypermedia document to another spot within that document or a different one.
Hyperlinks are another defining concept of the WWW and provide its identity as a collection of interconnected documents.
