The European Union</a> is a group of 27 European countries.
<br>After World War II, six countries decided to team up to jointly control their industrial production.
<br><br>This meant that none of them would be able to make weapons on its own and start a new war.
They increased their cooperation in 1957 by creating the ‘European Economic Community’ (EEC), which was the forerunner of today’s European Union (EU).
<br><br>When travelling between most EU countries, you no longer have to show your passport.
20 EU countries use the same currency: the euro.The EU has three common symbols:
a flag (12 golden stars on a blue background)
a hymn (Beethoven's 'Ode to Joy')

<p>a motto ('United in diversity')
Are you ready to discover what is special about each EU country?</p>
